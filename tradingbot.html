		<h3>Algorithmic Trading Bot</h3>

		<p> I created this project with the purpose of working on two areas which I was most interested in - Technology and Finance.
		<br>
		<br>
		Creating a trading bot using Python allowed me to not only work on my coding skills, but also learn how to combine my skills and areas of passion into a single project and use my financial knowledge for a project.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		QuantConnect allowed me to backtest on the stock market with stocks such as S&P500 and Qualcomm. Experimenting with algorithms allowed me to see how different the financial market operated with the surge of COVID-19, and eventually I managed to earn a 26.82% return
		In particular, I was very interesetd in being able to test a certain stock which I had won an investment management competition for, which was Qualcomm, a smartchip company. 
		<br>
		A DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) model which I had made with my team in mid 2021 predicted that the stock would return a rough 12% earning, and surprisingly my quantitative trading algorithm was able to match this.
		<br>
		This project was a perfect synthesis of both my studies and extracurriculars in finance and software development.
